I'm Travis Widmann, a data analyst with research experience in exercise science and public health. Studied studio arts in undergrad before taking a hard pivot into the exercise and fitness realm, whence I came to attain an MA, whence I entered the STEM world proper by developing an obsession with data, research methods, and coding.
